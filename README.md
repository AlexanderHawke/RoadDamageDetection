# RoadDamageDetection
CSI 4900 University of Ottawa Honours Project - Road Damage Detection

This is the GitHub repository for my CSI 4900 Honours Project on AI object detection for road damage. We used Jupyter Notebooks and Google Colab as our collaborative code and cloud computing solution, allowing us to utilize their GPUs to train our model. Below are links to the Google Drive that houses all of our code and some result outputs, as well as the full report on our project and the results.
